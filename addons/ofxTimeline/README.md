ofxTimeline is a simple to use openFrameworks add on for graphically editing values over time.

It's a lot like other openFrameworks GUIs that connect your parameters in code to an editable graphical interface. However ofxTimeline has the concept of time built into it, letting you create smoothly changing values or events occurring at specific moments. Borrowing concepts from Flash, Ableton Live, Adobe After Effects and Final Cut Pro to give your app powerful time controls with just a few lines of code.

## General tools for specific projects ##

ofxTimeline is an inquiry into how reusable components for building intuitive applications can change the way we create. 

Interface based applications for creative media are most commonly expensive big box applications like After Effects or Cinema4d, which deny creative reinterpretation or modification by their users. Open source alternatives are tied up in huge projects like [Blender](http://blender.org), [VLMC](http://www.videolan.org/vlmc/) and [Audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net/). Even very talented programmers have trouble extracting reusable pieces from these applications for creative reimagination. Moreover their [GPL licensing](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html) is a deal breaking restriction for inclusion in creative coding platforms like openFrameworks, Processing, and Cinder that require commercially viable licenses.

If an ecosystem of components for building small and intuitive media applications were to exist, what new processes could we invent? What collaborations between creative coders and other designers and artists would emerge?

## Including ofxTimeline in your openFrameworks project

### Clone ofxTimeline and dependencies 
to download the timeline open up the terminal and type

    $cd of_0071_osx_release/addons
    $git clone https://github.com/YCAMInterlab/ofxTimeline.git
    $cd ofxTimeline/
    $./clone_addons.sh

This will download the necessary addons, but won't overwrite any changes if you already have some of them installed

### Add ofxTimeline to your project
In Xcode open up the project you'd like to include the timeline. Drag and drop the ofxTimeline folder in from the finder into Xcode navigator under addons/

If you plan on using the Audiowaveform see additional instructions. Otherwise you can remove the examples-*/, and libs/ folder, as well as removeing the referenc to the ofxTLAudioTrack source files

### Add a timeline to your code

in your testApp.h file add:

    #include "ofMain.h"
    #include "ofxTimeline.h" //add timeline include

    class testApp : public ofBaseApp{
    public:
      ofxTimeline timeline; //inside of the class add a timeline

in your setup fon testApp.cpp file set up the timeline

    //--------------------------------------------------------------
    void testApp::setup(){
      
      timeline.setup(); //registers events
      timeline.setDurationInSeconds(60); //sets time
      timeline.setLoopType(OF_LOOP_NORMAL); //turns the timeline to loop
      
      //add a track
      timeline.addKeyframes("MyCircleRadius", ofRange(0, 200));
  
in your draw or update function, read the value
  
    //--------------------------------------------------------------
    void testApp::draw(){
      //the value of changingRadius will be different depending on the timeline
      float changingRadius = timeline.getKeyframeValue("MyCircleRadius"),
      //use the value for something amazing!
      ofCircle(mouseX, mouseY, changingRadius);
      //don't forget to draw your timeline so you can edit it.
      timeline.draw();
    }
    
It's a good convention to put in hotkeys for play and show hide in keyPressed

    //--------------------------------------------------------------
    void testApp::keyPressed(int key){
      if(key == ' '){
        timeline.togglePlay();
      }
      if(key == 'h'){
        timeline.toggleShow();
      }
    }

## Track Types
ofxTimeline has several built in track types for doing standard timeline tasks. 

### Bangs
![Bangs](http://www.jamesgeorge.org/images/ofxtimeline/github/BangTrack.png)

A bang is a simple time marker that sends an event when the playhead passes it. To use a bang track you need a class that listens to bang events, like so:

MyClass.h

      ofxTimeline timeline;
      void receivedBang(ofxTLBangEventArgs& bang);
      
MyClass.cpp

    //--------------------------------------------------------------
    void MyClass::setup(){
      timeline.addBangs("trigger particles");
      ofAddListener(timeline.events().bangFired, this, &testApp::receivedBang);
    }
    
    //--------------------------------------------------------------
    void MyClass::receivedBang(ofxTLBangEventArgs& bang){
      ofLogNotice("Bang fired from track " + bang->track.getName());
      if(bang.track->getName() == "trigger particles"){
        particleGenerator.start(); //some example response
      }
    }
    
.

    Inheritance: ofxTLTrack -> ofxTLKeyframes -> ofxTLBangs

### Tweens ###
![Tweens](http://www.jamesgeorge.org/images/ofxtimeline/github/TweenTrack.png)

Tweens change a value between a min and max range smoothly over time, edited with keyframes that have interpolation.

Right clicking a keyframe on the timeline brings up a selection window to change the interpolation value. These are based on the Penner equations found in [ofxTween](https://github.com/arturoc/ofxTween)

    Inheritance: ofxTLTrack -> ofxTLKeyframes -> ofxTLTweens

### Flags ###
![Flags](http://www.jamesgeorge.org/images/ofxtimeline/github/FlagTrack.png)

Flags are like Bangs but allow the user to enter text on each flag. The value can be read in the event

    //--------------------------------------------------------------
    void MyClass::receivedBang(ofxTLBangEventArgs& bang){      
      ofLogNotice("Bang fired from track " + bang.flag);
    }   

.

    Inheritance: ofxTLTrack -> ofxTLKeyframes -> ofxTLBangs -> ofxTLFlags

### Switches ###
![Switches](http://www.jamesgeorge.org/images/ofxtimeline/github/SwitchTrack.png)

Switches provide a simple control to turn regions of the timeline on and off.

    Inheritance: ofxTLTrack -> ofxTLBangs -> ofxTLSwitches

### VideoTrack ###
![VideoTrack](http://www.jamesgeorge.org/images/ofxtimeline/github/VideoTrack.png)

VideoTracks let a user interactively scrub through a video and sequence effects in time with the playback. When a video track is added the video playback will control the playback of the entire timeline. 

        ofxTLVideoTrack* videoTrack = timeline.addVideoTrack("Video", videoPath);
        if(videoTrack != NULL){ //in the case the video load failed check against null
            timeline.setFrameRate(videoTrack->getPlayer()->getTotalNumFrames()/videoTrack->getPlayer()->getDuration());
            timeline.setDurationInFrames(videoTrack->getPlayer()->getTotalNumFrames());
            timeline.setTimecontrolTrack(videoTrack); //video playback will control the time        
        }

The timeline's duration must match the video's duration.

    ofxTLTrack -> ofxTLImageTrack -> ofxTLVideoTrack


### AudioTrack ###
![AudioTrack](http://www.jamesgeorge.org/images/ofxtimeline/github/AudioTrack.png)

AudioTracks let a user interactively scrub through an audio track and sequence effects in time.

To add an AudioTrack to your project, add the declaration to your .h file

    ofxTimeline timeline;
    ofxTLAudioWaveform waveform;

And n your .cpp file add the track and load a file

    //--------------------------------------------------------------
    void testApp::keyPressed(int key){
        //... setup stuff
        timeline.addTrack("Track", &waveform);
        waveform.loadSoundfile("myAudioFile.wav");
        timeline.setDurationInSeconds(waveform.getDuration());
    }

    //--------------------------------------------------------------
    void testApp::keyPressed(int key){
        if(key == ' '){
            //calling play on the waveform controls the timeline playback
    		waveform.togglePlay();
    	}
    }

The timeline's duration must match the audio's duration.

    ofxTLTrack -> ofxTLImageTrack -> ofxTLVideoTrack
