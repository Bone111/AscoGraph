(* pageFormat-Sample.

   In Version 0.3 all tagparameters can be
   specified using arbitrary units (mm,cm,in,pt,pc).
   When using the \pageFormat-Tag, it is recommended,
   that units are specified, as the default unit
   is halfspaces (half the space between to lines in
   a staff).
   You can use different units for different
   parameters. *)
