; This is a sample score for AnteScofo - Anticipatory Score Following
; Common messages include:
; 	BPM <float> : indicating tempo in BPM
;	<float1> <float2> <string> : indicate PITCH (MIDI or MIDIcent) + BEAT DURATION + CUENAME
;		The Beat duration can be ZERO, indicating a GRACE NOTE or "hors-temps" events.
;		A Pitch value of ZERO indicates silence.
;	TRILL	( <float1> <float2> ... <floatN> ) <floatN+> <string>: Indicate a Trill class
;		with based notes of <float-i> in MIDIcents. A trill, in this terminology is ONE event that
;		possess several sub-events in time - but all these sub-events contribute to one global event
;		in time. <floatN+> is the duration in beats and <string> is the cue name.
;		The trill class can successfully encode multi-phonics when used with yin~ or fiddle~
;	MULTI	( <float1> <float2> ... <floatN> ) <floatN+> <string>
;		Multi class is the same as Trills except that we want access to EACH of the events indicated
;		by <float-i>s. Think of the floats (MIDIcents) between parenthesis as a table of values in
;		time.
;		The Multi class can successfully encode continuous events such as Glissandi.
;	AUDIO OFF: Turns off audio so that events will be triggered automatically using the current
;		detected TEMPO and their corresponding score beat duration. It must be turned ON afterwards.
;		AUDIO OFF/ON can successfully detect problematic repeated notes!
;		AUDIO OFF/ON can be thought of as some sort of tempo locked Q-list.
;	TEMPO ON/OFF:	Turns tempo decoding on or off for places in the score where the tempo should not
;		be updated. A typical example is a FERMATA.
; NOTE: Note the space after and before the opening and closing parenthesis for TRILL and MULTI classes.
